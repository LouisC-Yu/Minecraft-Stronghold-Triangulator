Python program that uses the EasyOCR library to read the positional coordinates of the player and heading faced after throwing an eye of ender from their Minecraft debug screen, at 2 different positions, to triangulate a stronghold's position. Uses Tkinter to display recorded data and calculated Stronghold position
Recommend 2 sets of triangulation to get a sufficiently accurate position

How to use:
Throw an eye of ender, press F3 to open your debug menu, and aim your crosshair at the floating eye of ender as accurately as you can
Press "{" to record data. If any recorded data returns as "Try Again", walk forwards or back a bit and press again until successful. You may need to look slightly up or down, just make sure your heading stays the same
Then press "}" to finalise data, and repeat for the second coordinate
Once 2 sets of coordinates and headings are set, the Stronghold's position will be automatically displayed
